This project is a very interesting application of Neural Networks. My project reads a book given to it and then tries to generate text like the book. 

If trained on text messages my model would work as a next word predictor. 

This project focusses on the dependancy of the next word in a text only on the immediate previous word. 

It is interesting to note that the sentences formed by this predictor follows the english grammar structure to a greaat extent even though it was not able to capture singular/plural or subject-verb agreement properly. The sentence structure however mostly follows the subject - verb - object format and very interesting sentences have been formed.
